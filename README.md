# CNN-Keff
Physics blind CNN model for predicting effective thermal conductivity in 2D images.

The Python script utilizes one of the folders with the trained models to predict the effective thermal conductivity of the image uploaded, just a brief and simple example of how to use the trained models.

The packages required to run this code are PIL, numpy, Tensorflow/Keras, and os.
